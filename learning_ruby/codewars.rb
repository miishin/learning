#Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.
#Rules for a smiling face:
#Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
#A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
#Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D

# As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. 
# Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: 
# you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

# Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; 
# if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

# Definitely too wordy - the top solutions used recursion. I saw one use logarithms too which is super smart.

# This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:
# seven(times(five)) # must return 35
# four(plus(nine)) # must return 13
# eight(minus(three)) # must return 5
# six(divided_by(two)) # must return 3
# Requirements:

# There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
# There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby and Python)
# Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
# The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
# Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:

# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others.
